# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [Oslandia](http://oslandia.com/), we like workingg with Open Source tool
projects and handling Open (geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will
play with the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (/OSM/) map and
subsequent data. Here comes the second article of this series, dedicated to the
presentation of OSM data itself.

* Introduction

As you should know, OpenStreetMap is a project which creates and distributes
free geographical data for the world. Like Wikipedia, it's a community of people
who can create and update some content available for everyone. Thus, anyone can
edit buildings, roads, places or even trees and mailboxes!

Working with community-built data forces to take care of data quality. We have
to be confident with the data we work this. Is this road geometry accurate
enough? Is this street name missing? This is fundamental for companies and NGO
who use OSM on a daily basis.

Our main purpose is to answer to this question: *can you assess the quality of
[[https://www.openstreetmap.org][OpenStreetMap]] data? (and how?)* This post is dedicated to the data parsing,
from native OpenStreetMap API.

/pbf/ is the file extension for [[https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/][Protocol Buffer]]

* What do we mean by "data quality"

Let's remind you that OSM is a community, as Wikipedia, where everyone can
create, edit and delete entities. You can suppose that the quality of a
contribution depends on the user who made it.

If the user is experienced, you can suppose that the contribution should be
good. And when you don't have reference data to measure the data accuracy, you
can suppose that if the road was created a few years ago with 20 updates, it
should be complete and accurate enough.

** geospatial data quality components

Van Oort (2006) defines several spatial data quality criteria:

- lineage
- positional accuracy
- attribute accuracy
- logical accuracy
- completeness
- semantic accuracy
- usage, purpose, constraints
- temporal quality
- variation in quality
- meta-quality
- resolution

This classification has been recalled in further contributions,
however most studies focus on positional accuracy. For instance,
Haklay (2010), Koukoletsos /et al./ (2011) or Helbich /et al./ (2012)
compared OSM data with Ordnance Survey data, an alternative data
source considered as a ground truth.

There are two differences with our approach: we don't have any
geospatial data reference to cope with the positional
accuracy. Moreover the authors decided to take a snapshot of the OSM
data instead of using OSM history data.

** OSM contributors and data quality

Other references focus on OSM contributors. Arsanjani /et al./ (2013)
classified OSM contributors based on the quality and quantity of their
contributions in Heidelberg (Germany). Five classes are used:
"beginner", "regular", "intermediate", "expert", and "professional
mappers". The authors work with with reference data in addition to OSM
data, they can assess the positional accuracy of a
contribution. Moreover, they take into account the completness and the
semantic accuracy. Then Neis /et al./ (2014) proposed a whole set of
statistic dedicated to OSM contributors. They provide hand-made
groups, and characterize contributions regarding dates, hours, user
localisation and activity.

Additional references can be mentionned to overcome the OSM data
qualiy issue. The [[https://www.iso.org/committee/54904.html][ISO/TC 211 working group]] published a set of norms
for geographical information standardization. For instance, the norm
ISO19157:2013 (2013) cites some of quality attributes mentionned
above. See also the Wikipedia notice about the [[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_assurance][OSM quality assurance]]
which lists several tools to supervise the OSM data construction.

* From the OSM history dumps to usable data sets

Extracting OSM data is a simple but complex task.

+ simple because you just have to download the history dump in =pbf= ([[https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/][Protocol
  Buffer]]) or =osh= formats from [[https://planet.openstreetmap.org/][Planet OSM website]] (=osm= format refers to
  latest data, whereas =osh= refers to history data).
+ complex because when you want to extract data, it can be a long and tedious
  task

The PBF (Protocol Buffer) file format is quite big: ~57Go. Note that
the XML file is compressed with =bzip2=. It can be long (+36
hours) and take some place (1TB) if you uncompress it (see more on [[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm/full#Data_Format][OSM wiki]]).

The challenge here is to pass from these native format to in-base data
or /.csv/ files. Several tools exist to accomplish this effort:
[[https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql][osm2pgsql]], [[https://github.com/openstreetmap/osmosis][osmosis]], [[https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-tool][osmium-tool]] or [[https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium][osmium]]. We propose here to use the
latter, and its dedicated [[http://docs.osmcode.org/pyosmium/v2.11.0/][Python library]]. This Python extension can be
installed through /apt-get/:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get install python-pyosmium
#+END_SRC

...or via /pip/:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install pyosmium
#+END_SRC

* What sort of data are behind the OpenStreetMap API?

[[http://docs.osmcode.org/pyosmium/v2.11.0/][Pyosmium documentation]] is a rich source of information in order to
understand the /pyosmium/ library functioning. Several features can be
identified within the OSM data.

Within the OSM API, a set of OSM seminal entities can be easily identified:

- nodes, characterized by geographical coordinates;
- ways, characterized by a list of nodes;
- relations, characterized by a set of "members", /i.e./ nodes, ways
  or other relations.

In addition to these three element types, a fundamental object is the
change set. It describes a set of modifications done by a single user,
during a limited amount of time.

Each of these OSM objects are characterized by a set of common
attributes, that are IDs, timestamps, visible /(is the object still
visible on the API?)/, user ID, or a list of tags /(a tag being the
association between a key and a value)/.

Starting from these OSM elements, we can straightforwardly answer
typical question as:

+ How many nodes do each user create?
+ How frequent are the mofification for each contributor?
+ How many tags do each OSM element contain?
+ ...

Considering the history of OSM data makes the data set even more
complete: it allows us to study the temporal evolution of the API.

* Conclusion

The OSM data features are full of information. After extracting them,
we plan to use them in order to characterize the OSM data quality, as
described above. It will be the aim of next articles.
