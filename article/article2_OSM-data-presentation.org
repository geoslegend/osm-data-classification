# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [Oslandia](http://oslandia.com/), we like workingg with Open Source tool
projects and handling Open (geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will
play with the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) map and
subsequent data. Here comes the second article of this series, dedicated to the
presentation of OSM data itself.

* Introduction...

Introduction of the article

* What do we mean by "data quality"...

Introduction of the project, explain what is OSM data quality, call some
references to make the speech stronger

* What sort of data are behind the OpenStreetMap API?...

Present OSM data, its format, the available features (here we can cite
[Osmium]() documentation to get a clear overview of OSM data). Typically we
have .osm data *vs* .osh data

Write about the OSM API, give some example of OSM entities (node, way,
relation, change sets, users...), distinguish visible elements from deleted
ones

* From the OSM history dumps to usable data sets...

First choice: exploit in-base data, or .csv files !

Develop the extraction process with the pyosmium tool, capitalize from the
first article written by dga
