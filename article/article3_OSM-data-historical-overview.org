# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [Oslandia](http://oslandia.com/), we like workingg with Open Source tool
projects and handling Open (geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will
play with the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) map and
subsequent data. Here comes the third article of this series, dedicated to the
chronological overview of OSM data.

* Introduction...

Introduction of the article

* How to extract OSM data history...

** Get the data...

By taking a local example (*e.g.* Bordeaux-metropole), extract the OSM data
history and evaluate the API evolution time after time.

** Build the OSM historical evolution through a simple procedure...

We have a simple but seminal procedure called =datedelems= that allows us to
get the OSM API picture given a date. As a corollary we can build some time
series aiming to describe the evolution of the API in terms of OSM objects
(nodes, ways, relations) or users.

* How do the OSM API evolve through time?...

** Some object-focused insights of the OSM API evolution...

What is the temporal evolution of nodes, ways, relations?

Can we compare areas? (Hypothesis: some areas have been built faster than
others, *e.g.* compare a urban area and a desert area)

** Some global considerations: how many active users?...

This is necessarily uncomplete if we consider only local extraction. However we
can try to obtain the change set and user statistics for full-planet dumps.
