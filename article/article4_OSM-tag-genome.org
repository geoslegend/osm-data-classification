# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [Oslandia](http://oslandia.com/), we like workingg with Open Source tool
projects and handling Open (geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will
play with the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) map and
subsequent data. Here comes the fourth article of this series, dedicated to the
analysis of OSM tag genome, *i.e.* tag keys and values that are used within the
OSM API.

* Introduction...

Introduction of the article

* Overview of the OSM object tags...

What kind of tags do we have to characterize OSM objects ? There are tag keys
on the first hand and tag values on the other hand. It can be interesting to
describe both sets.

* Analyse of the global tag genome...

Provide a short statistical description of the tag genome, on a whole OSM
extraction.

- How many tag per object (node, way, relation)?
- What is the temporal evolution of object tags, and more specifically in terms
  of object version?

* Analyse the tag key/value frequency...

If we focus on specific tag keys, or tag values, it is straightforward to ask
how spread are some typical tags. For example, we can focus on road data, and
evaluate how many highway tag are available in the API.

:warning: The analysis has been undertaken in a very simple manner for now, a
few additional investigations are needed to make the blog article content
sufficiently substantial
