# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [Oslandia](http://oslandia.com/), we like workingg with Open Source tool
projects and handling Open (geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will
play with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (/OSM/) and the
subsequent data. Here comes the fourth article of this series, dedicated to the
analysis of OSM tag genome, *i.e.* tag keys and values that are used within the
OSM API.

:warning: The analysis has been undertaken in a very simple manner for now, a
few additional investigations are needed to make the blog article content
sufficiently substantial

* OSM tag parsing

What kind of tags do we have to characterize OSM objects ? There are tag keys
on the first hand and tag values on the other hand. It can be interesting to
describe both sets.

** Definition of a specified handler

class description and instanciation

** Description of the tag genome in some examples

show some object example

* Analyse of the global tag genome

Provide a short statistical description of the tag genome, on a whole OSM
extraction.

- How many tag per object (node, way, relation)?
- What is the temporal evolution of object tags, and more specifically in terms
  of object version?

** Let's tagging objects!

How OSM objects are tagged :

- how many tags;
- the most frequent tags (in general);

** OSM tags over time

- temporal evolution of tags associated to objects

* Analyse the tag key/value frequency

If we focus on specific tag keys, or tag values, it is straightforward to ask
how spread are some typical tags. For example, we can focus on road data, and
evaluate how many highway tag are available in the API.

** Keys on the left...

** ...Values on the right

* Conclusion
