# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [Oslandia](http://oslandia.com/), we like workingg with Open Source tool
projects and handling Open (geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will
play with the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (/OSM/) map and
subsequent data. Here comes the second article of this series, dedicated to the
comparison between OSM data and an alternative data source considered as a
"ground truth".

* Introduction...

Introduction of the article


* The limitation of an unsupervised learning approach...

Consider the OSM data quality only with OSM history data is powerful, however
we can not ignore that this approach contains major drawbacks. The first of
them is the abstraction of the method, that sounds as a black-magic-box
regarding the data.

Another point that is not addressed by this method is the geographical aspect
of data. It is kind of hard to consider that a road, for example, is
well-located without considering its geographical characteristics.

* Verify the geographical quality of OSM data...

** Methodology: use an alternative data source...

Present all alternative data sources, and evaluate their advantages as well as
their drawbacks

** Let's focus on orthoimages: the way to address the geospatial quality?...

How to compare OSM data with orthoimage? A road to image recognition...
