# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [[http://oslandia.com/][Oslandia]], we like working with Open Source tool projects and handling Open
(geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will play with the [[https://www.openstreetmap.org/][OpenStreetMap]]
(/OSM/) map and subsequent data. Here comes the eighth article of this series,
dedicated to the OSM data quality evaluation, through production of new maps.

* Description of OSM element

** Element metadata extraction

What is an OSM element: element metadata extraction

** Characterize OSM elements with user classification

As a recall, we have seen in the last post that OSM metadata, and especially
user metadata allow us to produce user clusters. These clusters give a roughly
faithful picture of the user ability to make OSM trustworthy.

Starting from previous observations, we can deduce a little bit more
information. Each OSM entity have received one or more contributions by listed
users. These users are either beginners, or intermediate users, or even OSM
experts, according to previous classification. Let's say the entity quality is
good if at least one experienced user contributes to it. That leads us to
classify the OSM entities themselves in return!

** Recover the geometry information

Even if =Pyosmium= library is able to retrieve OSM element geometries, we
realized some test with an other OSM data parser here: =osm2pgsql=

As the main operations, we must:
- build an OSM element metadata table from OSM data history
- parse a geometry-oriented extraction of OSM data with =osm2pgsql=
- merge both tables

* Keep it visual, man!

From the last conclusions, we are able to produce some customized maps, based
on hypothesis on entity quality. If each OSM entities (*e.g.* roads) can be
characterized in terms of quality, by the way of a synthetic score for example,
then we can draw quality maps by highlighting the most trustworthy entities, as
well as those with which we have to stay cautious.

** First step: simple metadata plotting

Number of user per roads, number of tags per roads, and so on, within PostGIS

** More complex: OSM data merging with alternative geospatial representations

Use the INSEE carroyed data to provide an alternative way of OSM data
representation: 200-meter squared tiles, within which OSM element statistics
are aggregated

** The cherry on the cake: representation of OSM elements with respect to quality

Design similar map than in previous section, with user classification
information: /e.g./ last contributor group

Idea: identify questionable OSM elements, that should be verified (they are not
necessarily of low quality!)
