# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [Oslandia](http://oslandia.com/), we like workingg with Open Source tool
projects and handling Open (geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will
play with the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) map and
subsequent data. Here comes the seventh article of this series, dedicated to
the OSM data quality evaluation.

* Introduction...

Introduction of the article

* Capitalize from clustering on metadata...

As a recall, we have seen in the last post that OSM metadata, and especially
user metadata allow us to produce user clusters. These clusters give a roughly
faithful picture of the user ability to make OSM trustworthy.

* Characterize OSM entities from user classification...

Starting from previous observations, we can deduce a little bit more
information. Each OSM entity have received one or more contributions by listed
users. These users are either beginners, or intermediate users, or even OSM
experts, according to previous classification. It is possible to design a
synthetic score applied to each entity by using this fact. Let's say the entity
quality is good if at least one experienced user contributes to it. That leads
us to classify the OSM entities themselves in return!

* Keep it visual, man!

From the last conclusions, we are able to produce some customized maps, based
on hypothesis on entity quality. If each OSM entities (*e.g.* roads) can be
characterized in terms of quality, by the way of a synthetic score for example,
then we can draw quality maps by highlighting the most trustworthy entities, as
well as those with which we have to stay cautious.
