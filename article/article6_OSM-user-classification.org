# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [Oslandia](http://oslandia.com/), we like workingg with Open Source tool
projects and handling Open (geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will
play with the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (/OSM/) map and
subsequent data. Here comes the sixth article of this series, dedicated to user
classification using the power of machine learning algorithms

* Introduction...

Introduction of the article

* Recall of the user metadata...

Present the perimeter of user metadata, by restraining the selected
features. Give some arguments to justify this limitation.

Typically, we will keep only element-related features (*i.e.* the sum of node-,
way- and relation counters) to make the analysis simpler.

:warning: some tests still have to be undertaken to verify that this step is
necessary, or if the following section (PCA) addresses the dimensionality issue

* Develop a Principle Component Analysis (PCA)...

If we keep every single
[previously-computed](https://git.oslandia.net/Oslandia/osland-ia/blob/master/article/article5_OSM-metadata-description.org)
features, we will have to cope with more than 140 variables. Reducing the
dimensionality of the problem appears as a unavoidable pre-requisite before
undertaking any classification effort.

** Design the PCA...

Choose the number of dimension according to the explained variance.

** Describe some individuals positioning after dimensionality reduction...

Can we interpret the dimension meaning, starting from some examples?

* Cluster the user starting from their past activity...

At this point, we have a set of active users (those who have contributed to the
focused area). We propose now to classify each of them without any knowledge on
their identity or experience with geospatial data or OSM API, by the way of
unsupervised learning. Indeed we will design clusters with the k-means
algorithm, and the only input we have are the synthetic dimensions given by
previous PCA. These dimensions contain information about the past contributions
of each user.

Recall that we are investigating on OSM data quality, it is quite hard to have
an absolute answer, especially without any trustworthy "ground truth". Here we
hypothesize that typical groups of users (*e.g.* beginners, intermediate,
advanced, experts...) will arise from the classification algorithm.

** k-means design: how many cluster may we expect from the OSM metadata?...

Investigate on the optimal number of clusters: we only have access to soft
recommendation given by state-of-the-art procedure, namely elbow method,
clustering silhouette and so on... How many clusters can be identified?

:warning: Some methods are still in a draft state, for now. They have to be
enhanced, or deleted from the analysis.

** k-means running: OSM contributor classification...

From a OSM data sample (we do not use full-planet data at this point...),
several kind of users arise. Here we will describe them, and interpret the
result in terms of API using: how does the API works? How is it fulfilled by
contributors?
